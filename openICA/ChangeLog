	* Permutation solving methods is changed.
	  New method utilize only unmixing matrix.

2008-09-01  Takahashi Yuu  <yuu-t@spacy6.naist.jp>

	* Release 0.0.4

	* Bug fixed: output signals are incorrect in bt_ica.
	  In bt_ica, four signals are output, e.g., y11.raw, y12.raw, y21.raw y22.raw.
	  However, in older version of bt_ica, y11.raw and y12.raw, or y21.raw and y22.raw
	  became the same signal. This bug is fixed.

	* Additional option:
	  In Release 0.0.3, the following option is also avaiable for 'rt_ica'.
	  I forgot to write this one.

	  --it:        Iterations of ICA for raw-input mode.

	* Release 0.0.3
	* File I/O mode for `rt_ica' are added.

	  In the previous version, rt_ica can only read from audio device 
	  and output separeted signals to audio device.
	  
	  In the new version, rt_ica can read from stereo raw file and output
	  separated signals to stereo raw file.
	
	* The following new options are added for `rt_ica'

	  -f, --input:  use specified stereo raw file instead of audio input
	  -o, --output: output to specified file instead of audio output
	  --mode:       default output mode [ICA]
	                In the previous version, we can only select
	                THROUGH/ICA mode by keyboard.
	                In this version, we can select mode by command line
	                option.
	  --source:     default target source index for ICA [0].
	                In the previous version, we can only select
	                which separated signal by keyboard.
	                In this version, we can select the separaeted signal
	                by command line option.
	
	* Note: separation performance is `not' improved.

	* Release 0.0.2
	* Some description error about 2D std::vector,e.g., D2_VECOTR, are fixed.
	  (This modification enables us to compile with newer g++)
	* All vector or matrix is declared as std::vector based type.
	* The performance is `not' improved.
